# Fix Next.js Hydration Mismatch Error

## Steps to Complete

- [x] 1. Applied targeted fix using suppressHydrationWarning on select elements
- [x] 2. Ensured consistent initial state values between server and client
- [x] 3. Used proper option values in select elements to prevent mismatches
- [x] 4. Added suppressHydrationWarning to select elements to ignore hydration mismatches
- [x] 5. Applied fix to all select elements in the component

## Solution Applied

The hydration mismatch error has been resolved by adding the `suppressHydrationWarning` prop to all `<select>` elements in the Home component. This specifically ignores hydration warnings caused by browser extensions adding attributes like `fdprocessedid` to form elements, which is the root cause of the Next.js hydration mismatch error.

The fix is minimal and targeted, preserving server-side rendering while preventing the hydration warnings from causing the application to fail.
